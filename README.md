The Dynamic Task Map with information, or DTMi, is an extension of the DTM interface. DTMi extends the original DTM interface by introducing (a) grouping of tasks by functional module within distinctly colored convex hulls, (b) a dedicated panel on the right side for displaying additional task information that is not communicated by the graph itself, (c) an improved search interface.
